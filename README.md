# End-of-field-challenge (BeCode)

**This project was meant to determine and represent my skill level on css.
The end goal is to replicate an interface in a pixelperfect way, using a given mockup.**

## How did I do it?
My standard go-to is setting up the mockup as a background with the opacity lowered to +-0.5,
This helps me recreate the image. 


### Overview

**Interface 1**; This interface is a classic advertisement containing three logos and three corresponding slogans.
Normally i prefer to work with a grid but seeing that I only needed one row, I went for the flexbox properties instead. 

I had some trouble with the fonts, finding the right font and styling it properly. It never seems to implying into my website. Have to take some time to find the correct syntax, I think.
Also, I obtained the logos through "snip & sketch" option on this laptop. As a result, the dimensions of the logos are hard to work with since they are all a tiny bit different (1-2px max). 
Overall I am fairly happy with the result, seeing that I am not truly a CSS perfectionist. 

**Interface 2**; This interface proved to be a tad more difficult than anticipated. 
I started off with a table design which offered alot of flexibility so I could position everything real smooth.
When I was reminded that we need to use the propper semantics, I had to switch to the slightly harder navigation bar instead. Overall, the outcome is not bad but the icons are certainly not pixelperfect.
I assume this is due to the tedious amount of divs I used and perhaps the display option that I gave them.
Time flies when you are having fun, so I couldn't afford to make drastic changes into the structure of my html file.
I am confident that one morning with the idea flashing in front of my eyes.
