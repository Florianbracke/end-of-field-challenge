# End-of-field-challenge (BeCode)

**This project was meant to determine and represent my skill level on css.
The end goal is to replicate an interface in a pixelperfect way, using a given mockup.**

## How did I do it?
My standard go-to is setting up the mockup as a background with the opacity lowered to +-0.5,
This helps me recreate the image. 


### Overview

Interface 1; This interface is a classic advertisement containing three logos and three corresponding slogans.
Normally i prefer to work with a grid but seeing that I only needed one row, I went for the flexbox properties instead. 

I had some trouble with the fonts, finding the right font and styling it properly. 
Also, I obtained the logos through "snip & sketch" option on this laptop. As a result, the dimensions of the logos are hard to work with since they are all a tiny bit different (1-2px max). 
Overall I am fairly happy with the result, seeing that I am not truly a CSS perfectionist. 

Interface 2;
